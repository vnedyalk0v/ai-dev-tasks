# üöÄ AI Development Framework for Cursor ü§ñ

Welcome to the **AI Development Framework**! This repository provides a collection of `.mdc` (Markdown Command) files designed to supercharge your **application development** workflow within the [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) editor. By leveraging these commands with Cursor's AI Agent, you can systematically approach building high-quality applications with consistent architecture, robust security, and optimal performance.

Stop building inconsistent applications with AI and start developing with structured, quality-focused development practices!

## ‚ú® The Core Idea

Building applications with AI often leads to inconsistent code, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues across projects. This framework brings systematic development practices, code quality standards, and security/performance focus to AI-assisted development by:

1.  **Comprehensive Development Planning:** Creating detailed Project Specification Documents (PSD) that ensure consistent architecture and quality standards
2.  **Structured Implementation:** Breaking down development into logical phases with built-in quality checkpoints
3.  **Systematic Execution:** Guiding the AI through each development phase with proper code quality, security, and performance considerations
4.  **Quality Assurance:** Built-in testing, code review, and optimization practices throughout development

This structured approach ensures consistent, secure, and performant applications across all your projects - whether building HRM systems, portfolio websites, product websites, or any other applications.

## Workflow: From Idea to Quality Application üí°‚û°Ô∏èüíª

Here's the step-by-step process for building consistent, high-quality applications:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Project Specification Document (PSD)

First, establish the complete development blueprint for your application. A PSD defines architecture, quality standards, security requirements, and performance targets.

1.  Ensure you have the `create-project-spec.mdc` file accessible.
2.  In Cursor's Agent chat, initiate PSD creation:

    ```
    Use @create-project-spec.mdc
    Here's the application I want to build: [Describe your application/project]
    Reference these files if relevant: [Optional: @existing-file1.py @existing-file2.ts]
    ```

    _(Pro Tip: For comprehensive PSDs, using MAX mode in Cursor is highly recommended for thorough project analysis.)_

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Your Complete Development Task List

With your PSD drafted (e.g., `project-spec-hrm-system.md`), generate a comprehensive, phase-based development plan that ensures quality throughout the development process.

1.  Ensure you have `generate-project-tasks.mdc` accessible.
2.  In Cursor's Agent chat, create the development task list:

    ```
    Now take @project-spec-hrm-system.md and create the complete development tasks using @generate-project-tasks.mdc
    ```

    _(Note: Replace with your actual PSD filename)_

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Review Your Development Roadmap

You'll now have a comprehensive development roadmap with:

- **6 structured development phases** (Setup ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí MVP ‚Üí Advanced Features ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Optimization)
- **Quality-focused task breakdown** for each phase
- **Complete project structure** with proper file organization
- **Security and performance considerations** built into each phase

This provides a complete development roadmap focused on building quality, maintainable code.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Execute Development Phases Systematically

Use `process-project-tasks.mdc` to guide systematic execution through your development phases with built-in quality gates and code review processes.

1.  Create or ensure you have the `process-project-tasks.mdc` file accessible.
2.  In Cursor's Agent chat, start with Phase 1:

    ```
    Please start with Phase 1 (Project Setup & Development Environment) and use @process-project-tasks.mdc
    ```

    _(Important: You only need to reference `@process-project-tasks.mdc` for the first phase. The instructions guide the AI through all subsequent phases.)_

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Phase-by-Phase Review and Approval ‚úÖ

As the AI completes each major development task within a phase:

- **Review the implementation** against the project requirements and quality standards
- **Approve progress** with "yes" to continue to the next major task
- **Provide feedback** if code quality, security, or performance improvements are needed
- **Track completion** as phases are systematically completed with quality assurance

You'll see steady progress through:

- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Development environment setup, code quality tools, coding standards
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Database design, authentication, core application architecture
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3**: MVP feature development with proper testing and documentation
- ‚úÖ **Phase 4**: Advanced features, integrations, and enhanced user experience
- ‚úÖ **Phase 5**: Comprehensive testing, code review, and quality assurance
- ‚úÖ **Phase 6**: Performance optimization and security hardening

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Create Project Specification:** Use `create-project-spec.mdc` with either:

   - **Structured approach:** Fill out `project-information-template.md` and reference it
   - **Direct approach:** Describe your project directly in natural language

2. **Generate Task Roadmap:** Use `generate-project-tasks.mdc` to create a detailed 6-phase development plan with complexity-adjusted tasks and cross-platform considerations

3. **Execute Development:** Use `process-project-tasks.mdc` to systematically implement each task with quality validation, security scanning, and performance optimization

### Two Ways to Start Your Project

**Option 1 - Structured Template (Recommended for complex projects):**

```
Use @create-project-spec.mdc
Here's the application/project information.md
```

**Option 2 - Direct Description (Great for quick starts):**

```
Use @create-project-spec.mdc
Here's the application I want to build: [Describe your application/project]
```

## üí° Tips for Success
