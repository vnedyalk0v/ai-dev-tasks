# Rule: Generating a Project Task List from a Project Specification Document

## Goal

Create a comprehensive, phase-based task list in Markdown format based on an existing Project Specification Document (PSD). Guide development of consistent, secure, performant, and SEO-optimized applications through systematic development phases, emphasizing clean code principles, DRY implementation, and zero-vulnerability development practices.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/project/`
- **Filename:** `tasks-[project-spec-name].md` (e.g., `tasks-project-spec-hrm-system.md`)

## Process

1.  **Receive PSD Reference:** The user points you to a specific Project Specification Document file
2.  **Analyze PSD:** Read and analyze all sections of the PSD, paying special attention to:
    - Technical architecture and technology decisions
    - Complexity assessment score (Simple/Medium/Complex)
    - Feature prioritization (MoSCoW) and dependencies
    - Cross-platform requirements and device support
    - Quality standards, SEO requirements, and development phases
3.  **Assess Project Complexity:** Based on the PSD complexity score, adjust task granularity:
    - **Simple projects:** Combine related sub-tasks, focus on core functionality
    - **Medium projects:** Standard task breakdown as templated
    - **Complex projects:** Add additional sub-tasks for architecture, testing, and integration
4.  **Phase 1: Generate Development Phases:** Based on the PSD analysis, create the file and generate the main development phases. Present these phases to the user in the specified format. Inform the user: "I have generated the development phases based on the PSD. Ready to generate the detailed tasks for each phase? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go"
6.  **Phase 2: Generate Detailed Tasks:** Once confirmed, break down each development phase into major tasks, and each major task into actionable sub-tasks
7.  **Identify Project Structure:** Based on the tasks and PSD, identify the complete project structure including directories, configuration files, source files, tests, and documentation
8.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine phases, tasks, sub-tasks, project structure, and notes into the final Markdown structure
9.  **Save Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/project/` directory

## Output Format

Generate the project task list following this structure exactly:

```markdown

## Interaction Model

Pause after generating development phases to get user confirmation ("Go") before proceeding to generate detailed tasks. This ensures the high-level development plan aligns with user expectations and emphasizes quality, security, and performance standards before diving into implementation details.

## Target Audience

Target the task list for **software developers** who will implement the complete application development lifecycle, focusing on code quality, security, performance, SEO optimization, and clean code principles with zero tolerance for vulnerabilities.

  - **Complex projects:** Add additional sub-tasks for architecture, testing, and integration
- **IMPORTANT: Include database tasks (4.0) ONLY if the PSD indicates data storage/persistence requirements**
- **IMPORTANT: Include authentication tasks (5.0) ONLY if the PSD indicates user management requirements**
- **IMPORTANT: Include PWA tasks (3.4, 13.2) ONLY if the PSD specifies PWA requirements**
- **CRITICAL: Always include project structure documentation tasks (1.6, 2.8, 3.6) to prevent directory confusion and file duplication**
